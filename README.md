# ESLint Plugin: VibeCoding 🤖🚫

> **Stop robots from ruining your code vibes!**

This ESLint plugin contains custom rules designed to prevent common bad practices that AI assistants (and humans who code like robots) often make. Because sometimes the best code is the code that doesn't overthink everything.

## 🎯 What This Plugin Does

We've all been there - you ask an AI to help with some code, and it gives you a 500-line solution for a problem that could be solved in 10 lines. Or it creates variable names that look like they were generated by a random string generator. This plugin helps prevent those "robot moments" in your codebase.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-vibecoding
```

## 📝 Usage

Add `vibecoding` to your ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": ["plugin:vibecoding/recommended"]
}
```

Or configure individual rules:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["vibecoding"],
  "rules": {
    // Rules will be configured here
  }
}
```

## 🛡️ Rules

### `no-optional-properties`

Prevents optional properties in TypeScript types and interfaces to encourage explicit design decisions. Optional properties often indicate unclear requirements or lazy design.

**Why this rule exists:**
Optional properties can make code harder to understand and maintain. They often indicate that the developer hasn't thought through the requirements clearly. This rule encourages you to either:

- Make the property required if it's always needed
- Use union types (e.g., `string | undefined`) for truly optional values
- Document why a property is optional with a comment

**Examples:**

❌ **Bad:**

```typescript
interface User {
  name?: string; // Error: Optional property without explanation
  email: string;
}
```

✅ **Good:**

```typescript
interface User {
  name: string; // Required property
  email: string;
}
```

✅ **Good with explanation:**

```typescript
interface User {
  //optional: This field is only set after email verification
  verifiedAt?: Date;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

**Configuration:**

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "vibecoding/no-optional-properties": "error"
  }
}
```

## 🤖 Why "Anti-Robot" Rules?

Let's be honest - AI assistants (including the one that might have helped write this README 😄) have some common tendencies:

1. **Over-engineering everything** - Why use a simple function when you can create a full-blown class hierarchy?
2. **Verbose naming** - `calculateUserAuthenticationTokenValidationStatus` instead of `isValidToken`
3. **Magic patterns** - Using complex design patterns when a simple approach would work
4. **Copy-paste syndrome** - Repeating the same boilerplate everywhere
5. **Documentation overkill** - Commenting every single line of obvious code

This plugin helps keep your code human-friendly and maintainable.
