# ESLint Plugin: VibeCoding 🤖🚫

> **Stop robots from ruining your code vibes!** 

This ESLint plugin contains custom rules designed to prevent common bad practices that AI assistants (and humans who code like robots) often make. Because sometimes the best code is the code that doesn't overthink everything.

## 🎯 What This Plugin Does

We've all been there - you ask an AI to help with some code, and it gives you a 500-line solution for a problem that could be solved in 10 lines. Or it creates variable names that look like they were generated by a random string generator. This plugin helps prevent those "robot moments" in your codebase.

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev eslint-plugin-vibecoding
```

## 📝 Usage

Add `vibecoding` to your ESLint configuration:

```json
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:vibecoding/recommended"
  ]
}
```

Or configure individual rules:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["vibecoding"],
  "rules": {
    // Rules will be configured here
  }
}
```

## 🛡️ Rules

*Coming soon!* Rules will be added here as they are developed.

## 🤖 Why "Anti-Robot" Rules?

Let's be honest - AI assistants (including the one that might have helped write this README 😄) have some common tendencies:

1. **Over-engineering everything** - Why use a simple function when you can create a full-blown class hierarchy?
2. **Verbose naming** - `calculateUserAuthenticationTokenValidationStatus` instead of `isValidToken`
3. **Magic patterns** - Using complex design patterns when a simple approach would work
4. **Copy-paste syndrome** - Repeating the same boilerplate everywhere
5. **Documentation overkill** - Commenting every single line of obvious code

This plugin helps keep your code human-friendly and maintainable.
